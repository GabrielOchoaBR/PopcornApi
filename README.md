# PopcornApi

**Description:**

PopcornApi is a CRUD application for managing movies and TV series, built with C# for maintainability and scalability. It leverages design patterns and best practices for a well-structured codebase.

**Design Patterns:**

* **Mediator Pattern:** Facilitates communication between components, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
* **Decorator Pattern:** Dynamically adds functionality to objects without modifying their base class, offering flexibility and reusability.
* **UnitOfWork Pattern:** Encapsulates database operations for data consistency and simplified transaction management.

**Best Practices:**

* **Clear Architecture:** Separates concerns into distinct layers (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) for better organization and testability.
* **Fluent Validation and Assertions:** Provides readable and expressive validation rules and test assertions, improving code clarity.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:** Extensive unit and integration tests ensure code correctness and catch regressions early.
* **DDD and TDD:** DDD principles guide application structure around the domain model, while TDD helps write concise and focused tests.
* **Logging:** Provides comprehensive logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring.
* **Authentication and Authorization with Policy:** Implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms with policies for access control.
